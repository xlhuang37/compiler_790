               Encoder with index and pulse on compare example description


To emulate a quadrature encoder, TIM1 is configured in toggle mode to generate
2 quadrature signals on PC0 and PC1 at 250Hz.
So encoder clock = 250 * both edge * both signal = 1kHz.
GPIO PC2 is used to emulate index. Index occurs at each update event determined by repetition counter.

TIM3 is configured in encoder mode interface, counting on TI1 and TI2.
TIM3 channel 3 is used as pulse on compare. It is configured so that compare match occurs only when index is inactive.

Example execution:
At initialization, quadrature encoder emulator is active but index emulation is deactivated.
Thus encoder interface counts up and is able to reach value to trig pulse on compare.
Pulse on compare waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope on PB0.
Pulse duration is PW * 2^(PWPRSC)/SystemCoreClock = (255 * 128) / 170000000.

If BUTTON_USER is pressed, Index is activated. Thus encoder interface counter is reset before reaching pulse on compare match.
Pulse waveforms is no more present.

If BUTTON_USER is pressed again Index is deactivated.

The Encoder CH1/CH2, Index(ETR) and Pulse On Compare waveforms can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

    - Connect PC.00 (A5 - pin 38 in CN7 connector) TIM1 Channel 1
      to PA.06 (D12 - pin 13 in CN10 connector) TIM3 Channel 1.
    - Connect PC.01 (A4 - pin 36 in CN7 connector) TIM1 Channel 2
      to PA.04 (A2 - pin 32 in CN7 connector) TIM3 Channel 2.
    - Connect PC.02(pin 35 in CN7 connector) GPIO used for Index
      to PD.02 (pin 4 in CN7 connector) TIM3 ETR.
    - Connect PB.00 (A3 - pin 34 in CN7 connector) TIM3 Channel 3
      to oscilloscope to display pulse on compare waveform.
