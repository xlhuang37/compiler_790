@par Example Description

Use of the TIM peripheral to measure a periodic signal frequency 
provided either by an external signal generator or by 
another timer instance. This example is based on the STM32G4xx TIM 
LL API. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary service functions 
for optimization purposes (performance and size).
  
TIM1_CH1 is configured in input capture mode. The TIM1CLK frequency is set to 
its maximum value (Prescaler is /2 * 2 = 1) in order to get the best possible resolution.
So the TIM1 counter clock is SystemCoreClock.

SystemCoreClock is set to 170 MHz for STM32G4xx Devices.

The "uwMeasuredFrequency" variable contains the measured signal frequency.
It is calculated within the capture/compare 1 interrupt service routine.

The minimum frequency value to measure is TIM1 counter clock / TIMx_CCR1 MAX
                                              = 170 MHz / 65535

Due to TIM1 interrupt routine processing time (around 0.27us), the maximum
frequency value to measure is around 3.7 MHz.

TIM3_CH1 is configured to generate a PWM signal.  User push-button can be used to
change the frequency of this signal from 4 kHz up to 22 kHz by steps of 2 kHz.
It is then possible to run this example without a signal generator by connecting
TIM3_CH1 to TIM1_CH1.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G474RETx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-G474RE board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-G474RE RevC Set-up
    - When no signal generator is used TIM3_CH1 can be connected to TIM1_CH1:
      - TIM1_CH1  PA8: connected to pin 23 of Morpho connector CN10 ( Arduino connector CN09 pin D7 )  
      - TIM3_CH1  PA6: connected to pin 13 of Morpho connector CN10 ( Arduino connector CN05 pin D12 ) 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
