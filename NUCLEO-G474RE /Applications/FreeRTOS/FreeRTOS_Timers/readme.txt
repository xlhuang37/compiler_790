@par Application Description

How to use timers of CMSIS RTOS API.

This application creates a periodic timer and a thread, that toggle LED2
respectively every 200 ms and 400 ms, in a periodic cycle of 5 seconds.

The timer toggles LED2 every 200 milliseconds for 5 seconds then resumes thread.
The thread stop the timer and toggles LED2 every 400 milliseconds
for 5 seconds, then the thread  restarts the timer and suspends itself.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.
